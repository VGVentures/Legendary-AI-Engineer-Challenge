### Front End

Please populate this README with instructions on how to run the application!

cd frontend && npm install
npm run dev

The application should now be running at http://localhost:3000

// this is a more verbose way to run the app to see what that server actually is set to, etc.
cd frontend && npm run dev --verbose

rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install

npm install
